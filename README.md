# Mech_472_Mechatronics_and_Automation
This course focuses on design and analysis of mechatronic and automation systems. The following topics are covered: selection and integration of actuators, sensors, hardware, and software; computer vision; programming and software design for mechatronic systems; modelling and simulation; design of logic control systems; finite state machine methods; feedback control and trajectory generation; safety logic systems; case studies including automation systems, mobile robots, and unmanned vehicle systems.

1) Design mechatronics based automation systems including selection and integration of actuators, sensors, microcontrollers, computers, hardware, C++ software, and process. 
2) Implement C++ programs for automation of mechatronic systems using Arduino microcontrollers and personal computers.
3) Implement computer vision systems using C++ for mechatronics applications.
4) Debug and test C++ programs for automation and mechatronics applications.
5) Develop dynamic models and controllers for mechatronic systems.
6) Apply the topics above to develop C++ based automation systems for vision guided robots.
